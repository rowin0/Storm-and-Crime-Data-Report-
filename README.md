# Storm-and-Crime-Data-Report
## Project Background
The Miami police department has requested a Storm report and Crime Data Report (SCDR) using historical data documenting Storm frequency and Crime incidents from 10/1/2019 to 10/31/2019. According to Miami police there is a clear connection between storms and crime increase, this report is created so that they have undisputable evidence with the hopes that they can narrow down a timeframe when crimes happen and can proactively prepare in the future.
Insights and recommendations are provided in the following
* relationship between a dependent variable, in our case crime rate, and an independent variable, in our case storm factors like flood, hail or thunderstorm
* predictive analysis to determin the probability of crime happening in certain areas.
## Parameters and collect data
To create the report and analyze the connection between storms and crime incidents, the relevant weather data variables required for analysis should include weather variables like costal flood, strong wind rain, lighting, thunderstorm wind, tropical storm, hail, storm surge/tide and flash flood. Also, we have to look at the criminal data variables, violent crime, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, motor vehicle theft, aggravated assault, robbery, property crime, larceny -theft, and burglary.

By doing a bar chart we can illustrate Storm activity and crime activity for each day of October, from the results we can see that both variables are very close to each other.

Also, we can look at each type of crime categorized for each type of storm activity, we can see that hail and strong wind have the greatest number of crimes comparing to floods that have the least amount.

## Validation
To have a better understanding about crime activity for different types of weather, especially wanting to see the percentage for every type, I took the blank cells as clear weather, which needs to be clarified if so, but since it represents a significant percentage of 19.32% of the overall crime activity, I believe it shouldnâ€™t be discarded.

The visuals and tables created will provide the Miami police department with better insights into which regions and what types of crimes are most likely to occur depending on the type of weather.
